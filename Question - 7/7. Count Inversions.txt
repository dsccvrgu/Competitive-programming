Description

You have given an array A of N elements. An Inversion Count of the array is defined as the number of pairs (i, j) such that Ai > Aj and i < j.
Find the Inversion Count in A.

Input Format

The first line of input contains one integer T (1 ≤ T ≤ 1e5) — the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains N (2 ≤ N ≤ 1e5), the number of elements in an array A.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, …, AN, (0 ≤ Ai ≤ 1e9)
It is guaranteed that the sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 5 x 1e5.

Output Format

For each test case, print the answer on a new line denoting the Inversion Count.

Note

Explanation 1:
Inversion Pairs are (8, 4), (8, 2), (8, 1), (4, 2), (4, 1), (2, 1).

Explanation 2:
Inversion Pairs are (3, 1), (3, 2).

Explanation 3:
There are no Inversion Pairs. And hence, 0 Inversion Count.
