Description

Given an array A of N integers and an integer target, find three integers in A such that the sum is closest to the target (absolute value of (sum-target) is minimum). Print the minimum absolute value of (sum-target). You cannot select an index more than one. All three indexes should be distinct.

Input Format

The first line contains T, the number of test cases (1<=T<=100).

The first line contains two space-separated integers N, target where 1<=N<=10^3, -1e18<=target<=1e18.

Next line contains N space-separated integers (-1e9<=Ai<=1e9).

The Sum of N across all test cases â‰¤ 10^4.

Output Format

For each test case print the minimum absolute value of (sum-target).
